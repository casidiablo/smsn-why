# Take the power back! Build a knowledge graph!

[Semantic Synchrony](http://www.github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is an open-source (free) knowledge graph editor. A knowledge graph is what lets Google, Siri, WolframAlpha, probably the CIA, and others answer questions about the world. Unlike those systems, this one is easy to use -- much easier than Microsoft Word or Minecraft -- and more general. (Systems with fixed schema, by definition, limit what can be expressed.)

Semantic Synchrony lets you share different kinds of things with different people, or everyone (public), or nobody (private). It integrates with Git, so the entire change history (including authorship) is recorded, and errors can be undone. It is nonlinear, which allows it to stay better organized.
