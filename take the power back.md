# Take the power back!

[Semantic Synchrony](http://www.github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is an open-source knowledge graph editor. The knowledge graph is what lets Google, Siri, WolframAlpha, probably the CIA, and others able to answer questions about the world. Unlike those systems, this one is easy to use -- much easier than Microsoft Word or Minecraft.

Semantic Synchrony allows selective sharing. A small army of us are sharing a [public knowledge graph](https://github.com/synchrony/git-smsn/blob/master/our%20public%20knowledge%20graph.md), and we seek more wise contributors.
