# Take the power back!

[Semantic Synchrony](www.github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is an open-source knowledge graph editor. The knowledge graph is what lets Google, Siri, WolframAlpha, probably the CIA, and others able to answer questions about the world. Unlike those systems, this one is easy to use -- much easier than Microsoft Word or Minecraft. 

Sharing and privacy are both optional and both recommended. It integrates with Git, so the entire change history, including authorship, is recorded, and errors can be undone. Complex sharing hierarchies are possible: "Keep these ideas private on this computer; share these only with close friends; share these with people who are okay with sharing bad feelings; share these with everybody ..."

A tiny army of us are sharing a knowledge graph already, at (www.github.com/synchro
ny/data-public) and (www.github.com/synchrony/data-universal).
