[Semantic Synchrony](http://www.github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is an open-source (free) knowledge graph editor. A knowledge graph is what lets Google, Siri, WolframAlpha, probably the CIA, and others answer questions about the world. However, unlike those systems, Semantic Synchrony is easy to use -- much easier than Microsoft Word or Minecraft -- and more general.

That is because the other systems are optimized for computer reasoning, whereas Semantic Synchrony is optimized for human reasoning. The (current) limitations on "thinking" in computers means that a knowledge graph must adhere to some fixed schema, which limits what can be expressed, and how. Semantic Synchrony imposes no such limitation; knowledge in the graph is plain text, written however you like.

Semantic Synchrony lets you share different kinds of things with different people, or everyone (public), or nobody (private). It integrates with Git, so the entire change history (including authorship) is recorded, and errors can be undone. It is nonlinear, which allows it to stay better organized.
