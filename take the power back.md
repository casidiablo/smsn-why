# Take the power back!

[Semantic Synchrony](http://www.github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) is an open-source knowledge graph editor. The knowledge graph is what lets Google, Siri, WolframAlpha, probably the CIA, and others answer questions about the world. Unlike those systems, this one is easy to use -- much easier than Microsoft Word or Minecraft.

Semantic Synchrony lets you share different kinds of things with different kinds of people, or everyone (public), or nobody (private). A small army of us are sharing the [public portions of our knowledge graphs](http://github.com/synchrony/git-smsn/blob/master/our%20public%20knowledge%20graph.md), and we seek more wise contributors.
