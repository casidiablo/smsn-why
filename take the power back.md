# Take the power back! Build a knowledge graph!

Semantic Synchrony lets you share different kinds of things with different people, or everyone (public), or nobody (private). It integrates with Git, so the entire change history (including authorship) is recorded, and errors can be undone. It is nonlinear, which allows it to stay better organized.

## Graphs facilitate creative reading[](#graphs-facilitate-creative-reading)

Graphs let the user choose where to go. An explanation can be labeled as an explanation -- and if the reader already understands, they can skip it. Implications can be labeled as implications; if a reader wants to search recursively for all of a thing's implications, it is possible. Interesting things can be labeled interesting, beautiful things beautiful, mysteries myesterious, truths true -- and for each label, we can know how many people think so, and who.

Knowledge graphs empower readers to make choices for themselves, and they empower readers and writers to work together. Writers can avoid the guesswork, and instead tailor content to different kinds of readers, or to different moods of the same reader: "follow these links for the scientific details behind this story", "follow these links for the mythological underpinnings of this idea", "follow these for sociological implications of these theories", etc.
