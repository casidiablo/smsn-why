# Now anyone can process information nonlinearly!

We already think nonlinearly. Our emotions, for instance, are nonlinear: When you see someone make a face, in an instant you process dozens of related interpretations, motivations, explanations, and responses possible for it. The brain is a giant, beautiful web of concepts.

Spoken and written words, however, are linear. Every expression except the last is followed by another. The order of words spoken or written is the order of words heard or read.

A knolwedge graph allows users to write, process, and share nonlinear collections of ideas.
