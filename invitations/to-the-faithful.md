Knowledge maps for people of faith
--
If you have faith -- and I do -- you have it for reasons. You have seen things, in the world and in yourself. You have shared ideas with others, and together you have helped each other see beyond what one of you alone could see. You have faith because you have tried it and it worked.

You have faith, in other words, because you have evidence.

Faith is vauge, because human memory is only so great. This is why faith is so much easier to feel than to explain. It's why books were important to the development of religion. Computers offer us the potential to navigate more memories, faster, than books allow.

Faith is vague too because it concerns high, abstract principles: Faith is not about things like chemicals or gravity; it is about things like charity, humility, courage, trust, peace.

You deserve a knowledge graph, private but woven into the Internet, where you can read and write about concepts like that.

You don't have to share any of it. (Shared graphs in [Semantic Synchrony](http://www.github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki) offer selective privacy, so you can share just the parts you want to share.)

There is great power in sharing. A shared knowledge graph is a shared set of memories, that each member navigates and adds to in their own way. It feels very different from a shared book, because everyone reads the book in the same order. It can [feel like flying](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn-why/blob/master/the-best-game.md), or ping-pong, or [meditation](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn-why/blob/master/contempl%2C%20expr%2C%20transc.md), or science.
