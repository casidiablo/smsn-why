Good evening, Mr. Greenwald. It is an honor to be read by you or your staff; your reporting is a treasure.

I am a data scientist, software developer and economist. I am recruiting users and developers for Semantic Synchrony, a free, open-source system for creating and sharing knowledge graphs: https://github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki

Can you think of anybody who would be interested?

Sincerely yours,
